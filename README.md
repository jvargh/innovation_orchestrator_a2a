# Innovation Orchestrator (A2A + MCP) - Hackathon '25 - PoC

## Introduction
Innovation Orchestrator is a marketplace‑native, multi‑agent proof‑of‑concept that turns high‑level business objectives into launch‑ready strategies in **days, not months**. It demonstrates how a central orchestrator (inspired by Microsoft Semantic Kernel patterns) coordinates specialized agents via the **Agent‑to‑Agent (A2A)** protocol, while each agent uses a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** client to pull external context (market data, customer signals, partners, compliance/ESG, design assets).

This PoC showcases the **“Building the Agentic Economy”** vision: agents discover, negotiate, and transact value in a living marketplace, producing integrated outputs (e.g., a go‑to‑market plan) from a single request.

---

## Description
From a request like:
> “Identify and prepare a go‑to‑market plan for a **circular economy supply‑chain solution** in **LATAM**.”

the orchestrator:
1. **Discovers** suitable agents via A2A **Agent Cards**.
2. **Negotiates** with agents (RFP → PROPOSE → ACCEPT).
3. **Assigns tasks** with typed payloads.
4. Agents **fetch data** via MCP (mock client in this PoC).
5. Orchestrator **synthesizes** results into a board‑ready launch plan.

### Business Impact
- **Speed to market**: compresses months of cross‑functional work into days.
- **Stronger product‑market fit**: continuous feedback keeps plans relevant.
- **Scalable capability**: enterprise‑grade outcomes for teams of any size.
- **Risk reduction**: embeds compliance & sustainability from day one.

---

## Functionality (What You Can Do)
- **A2A Messaging**: in‑process router + message envelopes for peer agents.
- **Discovery**: each agent returns a **card** with capabilities & metadata.
- **Negotiation**: RFP/PROPOSE/ACCEPT lifecycle before tasks are executed.
- **Tasking**: orchestrator issues `TASK` with correlation IDs and awaits `RESULT`.
- **MCP Data Access (mocked)**: agents call a custom MCP client for:
  - Market trends & competitors
  - Customer sentiment & top needs
  - Partner discovery (suppliers/distributors)
  - Compliance & ESG snapshots
  - Design assets & user journeys
- **Synthesis**: orchestrator assembles all outputs into a unified plan.

---

## End‑to‑End Flow
1. **Ingestion**: Accept `region` and `product` via **file** (`--file`) or **CLI/interactive** input.
2. **Discovery**: Orchestrator sends `DISCOVER` to agents → receives Agent Cards (capabilities, intents).
3. **RFP Round**: Orchestrator sends `RFP` → agents reply with `PROPOSE` (cost/ETA).
4. **Accept**: Orchestrator sends `ACCEPT` to chosen agent(s).
5. **Task Execution**: Orchestrator sends `TASK` with inputs (e.g., `region`, `product`).
6. **MCP Calls**: Agents invoke the MCP client to fetch external context (mocked here).
7. **Results**: Agents return `RESULT` payloads.
8. **Synthesis**: Orchestrator compiles a **go‑to‑market plan** (market, customers, partners, compliance/ESG, design, launch plan).
9. **Completion**: Final plan is printed (and could be persisted or sent to another system).

```

---

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- No external dependencies required (pure Python PoC).

> In a production build you would install Semantic Kernel + A2A + MCP clients and replace the in‑process router and mock MCP with real endpoints.

---

## Setup & Run

### 1) Clone and enter the project
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>.git
cd <your-repo>/innovation_orchestrator_a2a
```

### 2) Provide inputs (three options)

**Option A — JSON file**
Create a file `input.json`:
```json
{
  "region": "LATAM",
  "product": "Circular Supply Chain Solution"
}
```
Run:
```bash
python -m innovation_orchestrator_a2a.main --file input.json
```

**Option B — CLI flags**
```bash
python -m innovation_orchestrator_a2a.main   --region LATAM   --product "Circular Supply Chain Solution"
```

**Option C — Interactive**
```bash
python -m innovation_orchestrator_a2a.main
# You will be prompted for region and product
```

---

## Implementation Notes
- **A2A Protocol**: `a2a_protocol.py` defines `Envelope` and `Intent` with a minimal router. Intents include: `DISCOVER`, `RFP`, `PROPOSE`, `ACCEPT`, `TASK`, `RESULT`, `INFO`, `ERROR`.
- **Agent Cards**: each agent advertises a `card()` describing capability and supported intents (used during discovery).
- **Negotiation**: orchestrator sends `RFP` and awaits `PROPOSE`; it then `ACCEPT`s and issues `TASK` to the target agent.
- **Correlation IDs**: the `Conversation` helper watches correlation IDs so the orchestrator can await specific responses.
- **MCP Client (mock)**: `mcp_client.py` provides deterministic fake data; swap this with real MCP servers (e.g., Azure Functions, data APIs).

---
# How to Run Innovation Orchestrator (File Input & Interactive Input)
Below is a complete example showing two ways to run the **Innovation Orchestrator**:
- Using a **JSON input file**
- Using **manual (interactive) input**

The sample outputs illustrate each stage: **ingestion**, agents using the mock **MCP** to fetch data, **agentic (A2A) chatter** logs, and the **final aggregated plan**.

---

## 1) Using a file as input

Create a JSON file (e.g., `input.json`) with the region and product:

```json
{
  "region": "APAC",
  "product": "Sustainable Packaging Solution"
}
```

Run the orchestrator with the file:

```bash
python3 -m innovation_orchestrator_a2a.main --file input.json
```

**Sample output:**

```text
[Orchestrator] Starting plan for product 'Sustainable Packaging Solution' in region 'APAC'
[Market Insight] Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
[Market Insight] Market trends for APAC: {...}  ← uses MCP to fetch market data
[Customer Insight] Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
[Customer Insight] Customer signals for Sustainable Packaging Solution: {...}  ← uses MCP to fetch sentiment data
[Compliance] Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
[Compliance] Regulations for APAC: {...}  ← uses MCP to fetch regulations/ESG data
[Partnership] Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
[Partnership] Partners for APAC: {...}  ← uses MCP to find suppliers/distributors
[Design] Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
[Design] Created design with style modern and palette navy/lime  ← uses MCP to pull design assets
[Go‑to‑Market] Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
[Go‑to‑Market] Compiled go‑to‑market plan for APAC
[Orchestrator] Plan execution completed

=== Aggregated Plan ===
region: APAC
product: Sustainable Packaging Solution
market_insights: {...}
customer_insights: {...}
compliance: {...}
partners: {...}
design: {...}
go_to_market: {...}

=== Agent Logs ===
-- Orchestrator --
  Starting plan for product 'Sustainable Packaging Solution' in region 'APAC'
  Plan execution completed
-- Market Insight --
  Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
  Market trends for APAC: {...}
-- Customer Insight --
  Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
  Customer signals for Sustainable Packaging Solution: {...}
-- Partnership --
  Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
  Partners for APAC: {...}
-- Compliance --
  Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
  Regulations for APAC: {...}
-- Design --
  Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
  Created design with style modern and palette navy/lime
-- Go‑to‑Market --
  Received unhandled ACCEPT message from orchestrator
  Compiled go‑to‑market plan for APAC
```

**Step through the flow:**

- **Ingestion:** The `--file` flag tells the orchestrator to load the `region` and `product` from `input.json`.
- **MCP access:** Each agent invokes the mock MCP client to fetch its domain data (market trends, customer signals, regulations, partners, design assets) before returning results.
- **Agentic chatter:** The log lines beginning “Received unhandled ACCEPT message…” and the subsequent “Market trends for …” represent the A2A lifecycle (**RFP → PROPOSE → ACCEPT → TASK → RESULT**).
- **Result:** The orchestrator aggregates all agent results into a unified plan and prints both the plan and each agent’s log.

---

## 2) Using manual (interactive) input

Run the orchestrator without flags:

```bash
python3 -m innovation_orchestrator_a2a.main
```

When prompted, enter values like:

```text
Enter the target region:  LATAM
Enter the high‑level product/solution description:  Circular Supply Chain Solution
```

**Sample output (abridged):**

```text
[Orchestrator] Starting plan for product 'Circular Supply Chain Solution' in region 'LATAM'
[Market Insight] Market trends for LATAM: {...}
[Customer Insight] Customer signals for Circular Supply Chain Solution: {...}
[Compliance] Regulations for LATAM: {...}
...
[Go‑to‑Market] Compiled go‑to‑market plan for LATAM
[Orchestrator] Plan execution completed

=== Aggregated Plan ===
region: LATAM
product: Circular Supply Chain Solution
market_insights: {...}
customer_insights: {...}
...
```

The process is identical to the file‑based run: the orchestrator collects `region` and `product` from the user, kicks off the same A2A negotiation/communication sequence, uses MCP for data, and finishes with a consolidated plan.

# Sample Input → Go‑to‑Market Plan (Final Output)
Here’s how a high‑level request is transformed into a launch‑ready go‑to‑market plan by the Innovation Orchestrator.

## 📥 Sample Input
```json
{
  "region": "LATAM",
  "product": "Circular Supply Chain Solution"
}
```

## 🔄 How It’s Processed
1. **Ingestion & Orchestration** – Orchestrator decomposes the goal and coordinates specialist agents via the Agent‑to‑Agent (A2A) protocol.
2. **Data via MCP** – Each agent uses the (mock) Model Context Protocol (MCP) client to fetch market, customer, compliance/ESG, partner, and design context.
3. **Agentic Chatter** – Agents negotiate and execute using A2A messages (RFP → PROPOSE → ACCEPT → TASK → RESULT).
4. **Synthesis** – Orchestrator aggregates all results into a unified go‑to‑market plan.

1. **Ingestion & Orchestration:** The orchestrator receives the region and product and breaks the goal into tasks. It uses the Agent‑to‑Agent (A2A) protocol to discover appropriate agents (market, customer, compliance, partnerships, design, go‑to‑market), negotiate capabilities, and assign tasks
2. **Data Acquisition via MCP:** Each specialized agent uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to fetch external data—market trends, customer sentiment, regulations, partner lists, design assets—showing how MCP connects agents to tools and data sources.
3. **Agentic Chatter:** As tasks progress, agents send messages back to the orchestrator. Logs like “Received unhandled ACCEPT message…” and “Market trends for LATAM: …” reflect the A2A lifecycle: discovery → RFP → proposal → task execution → results.
4. **Synthesis & Output:** When all agents finish, the orchestrator synthesizes the results into a unified plan—a complete go‑to‑market strategy.

## 📦 Example Final Output

    ]
  },
  "go_to_market": {
    "timeline": [
      ["Month 1","Finalize partnerships and approvals"],
      ["Month 2","Pilot with key suppliers/distributors"],
      ["Month 3","Full campaign rollout"]
    ],
    "assets": {
      "pitch_deck": "Opportunity in LATAM",
      "brochure": "Sustainability‑first value prop"
    },
    "channels": ["Online","Retail","B2B partner marketing"]
  }
}
```

This output shows the orchestrator has gathered market conditions, customer needs, regulatory status, partner options, design concepts, and launch sequencing, all from a single high‑level input. If you change the input—say, the region or product—the orchestrator will re‑evaluate the market, fetch different data via MCP, and produce a new plan tailored to that scenario.

# Roadmap / Next Steps
- Replace mock MCP with real MCP servers (Azure Functions, data APIs).
- Swap in‑process router with a message bus (Azure Service Bus, Kafka).
- Add agent **reputation, pricing, and bidding** to proposals.
- Incorporate **Semantic Kernel** planners & plugins for richer orchestration.
- Persist plans and artifacts to storage; add a simple web UI for demos.
